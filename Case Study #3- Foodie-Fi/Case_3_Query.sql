-- A. Customer Journey
-- Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.


SELECT customer_id, start_date, plan_name, price 
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE customer_id IN (1, 2, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19);

-- B. Data Analysis Questions
-- 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

-- Count distinct customer IDs to ensure each customer is counted only once.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(customer_id)) AS unique_customers
FROM subscriptions;

-- 2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value

-- DATE_TRUNC to group start dates by the beginning of each month.
-- Format the truncated date as MM (month) for grouping clarity.
-- Count the number of unique customers per month.

SELECT TO_CHAR (DATE_TRUNC('month',start_date), 'MM') AS trial_start_month, 
       COUNT (customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 0
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

-- 3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name

-- Join the subscriptions table with plans to access plan names.
-- Filter subscriptions with start dates after December 31, 2020.
-- Count the number of events per plan_name to track activity.

SELECT p.plan_name, COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE s.start_date > '2020-12-31'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

-- 4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?

-- Count the unique customer IDs associated with the churn plan (plan_id = 4).
-- Churn Percentage = (Churned Customers / Total Unique Customers) * 100.

SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS churn_customers,

    plan_id = 4;
	
	
-- 5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?

--  The LEAD window function finds the subsequent plan (next_plan) for each customer based on start_date.
--  Identify customers whose initial plan was a free trial (plan_id = 0) and whose next_plan is churn (plan_id = 4).
--  Count such customers and calculate the percentage relative to the total unique customers in the dataset.

WITH next_plans AS (
SELECT *,
          lead(plan_id, 1) over(PARTITION BY customer_id
          ORDER BY start_date) AS next_plan

                FROM subscriptions),0) AS churn_percentage
FROM churned_customers;

-- 6. What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?

--  The LAG window function retrieves the previous plan (previous_plan) for each customer based on start_date.
-- Focus on customers whose previous plan was a free trial (plan_id = 0).
-- Group the results by plan_name and calculate:
--         - The count of customers transitioning to each plan.
--         - The percentage of total customers who chose each plan after the trial.

WITH previous_plans AS (

              FROM subscriptions), 1) AS customer_percentage
FROM previous_plans
WHERE previous_plan = 0
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
	
-- 7. What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at 2020-12-31?

-- Identify the latest active plan for each customer as of 2020-12-31 using row_number().
-- Filter customers based on their most recent subscription plan.
-- Calculate the count and percentage breakdown for each plan_name.

GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

-- 8. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?

-- Filter for subscriptions that started in 2020 using the date range.
-- Focus on the "pro annual" plan by filtering with plan_id = 3.
-- Count the total number of unique customers who upgraded to this plan.

-- 9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?

-- Determine the first subscription date for each customer.
-- Identify the date when each customer upgraded to an annual plan (plan_id = 3).
-- Calculate the difference in days between these two dates, considering only customers who upgraded.
-- Compute the average difference across all relevant customers.

WITH customer_plans AS (

-- 10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)

-- Calculate the difference in days between a customer's first subscription and their annual plan upgrade date.
-- Divide customers into predefined 30-day segments for analysis.
-- Calculate the total number of customers for each segment.

-- C. Challenge Payment Question
-- The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:
-- monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
-- upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
-- upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
-- once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

CREATE TABLE payments (
  customer_id INTEGER,
  plan_id INTEGER,
  plan_name VARCHAR(20),
  payment_date DATE,
  amount DECIMAL(5,2),
  payment_order INTEGER
);

WITH RECURSIVE RecursivePayments AS (

-- D. Outside The Box Questions
-- 1. How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?

-- Aggregate revenue by month using the payment data.
-- Use both numerical and formatted month values for sorting and display.
-- GrowthÂ Rate= (CurrentÂ MonthÂ Revenue âˆ’ PreviousÂ MonthÂ Revenue) / PreviousÂ MonthÂ Revenue

WITH
  monthly_revenue AS (
    SELECT
      EXTRACT(MONTH FROM payment_date) AS payment_month,

      SUM(amount) AS revenue
    FROM
