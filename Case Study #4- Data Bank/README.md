## Case Study Questions and Solutions

### A-Customer Nodes Exploration

#### 1. How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(node_id)) AS unique_nodes
FROM customer_nodes;
```

| unique_nodes |
|--------------|
|5             |

---

### 2.	 What is the number of nodes per region?

```sql
SELECT cn.region_id, region_name,
COUNT(node_id) AS node_number 
FROM customer_nodes cn
JOIN regions r ON cn.region_id = r.region_id
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
```

| region_id | region_name | node_number |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 1         | Australia   | 770         |
| 2         | America     | 735         |
| 3         | Africa      | 714         |
| 4         | Asia        | 665         |
| 5         | Europe      | 616         |

The data reveals that Australia has the highest number of nodes, followed by America and Africa.

---

#### 3.	 How many customers are allocated to each region?

```sql
SELECT region_name,
COUNT(DISTINCT(customer_id)) AS customer_count 
FROM customer_nodes cn
JOIN regions r ON cn.region_id = r.region_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

| region_id | region_name | node_number |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 1         | Australia   | 770         |
| 2         | America     | 735         |
| 3         | Africa      | 714         |
| 4         | Asia        | 665         |
| 5         | Europe      | 616         |

Australia has the highest number of customers, followed closely by America and Africa. Europe has the lowest customer allocation among the regions.

---

#### 4.	 How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?

_Note: Records with the outlier date of 9999-12-31 were excluded from the calculation to ensure the accuracy of the results._

```sql
SELECT MAX (end_date) FROM customer_nodes;
```
| max_date    |
|-------------|
|9999-12-31   |


```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(end_date - start_date),0) AS avg_days
FROM customer_nodes
WHERE end_date != '9999-12-31';
```

| avg_days    |
|-------------|
|15           |

On average, customers are reallocated to a different node every 15 days. 

---

#### 5. What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region? 

```sql
WITH reallocation_day AS (
SELECT*, (end_date - start_date) AS reallocation_days
FROM customer_nodes
WHERE end_date != '9999-12-31'
)
SELECT region_name, 
       PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY Reallocation_Days) AS Median,
       PERCENTILE_CONT(0.8) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY Reallocation_Days) AS P80,
       PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY Reallocation_Days) AS P95
FROM reallocation_day rd
JOIN regions r ON rd.region_id = r.region_id
GROUP BY 1;
```
| region_name | median | p80 | p95 |
|-------------|--------|-----|-----|
|  Africa     | 15     | 24  | 28  |
|  America    | 15     | 23  | 28  |
|  Asia       | 15     | 23  | 28  |
|  Australia  | 15     | 23  | 28  |
|  Europe     | 15     | 24  | 28  |

The median reallocation duration is consistent at 15 days across all regions. The 80th and 95th percentiles show slight regional variations, with most values clustering around 23â€“28 days, indicating similar patterns in reallocation times across regions.

---

### B-Customer Transactions

#### 1.  What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?

```sql
SELECT txn_type, 
       COUNT(*) AS transaction_count,
       SUM (txn_amount) AS total_amount
FROM customer_transactions
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

| txn_type   | transaction_count | total_amount |
|------------|-------------------|--------------|
|  deposit   | 2671              | 1359168      |
|  purchase  | 1617              | 806537       |
|  withdrawal| 1580              | 793003       |

Deposits are the most frequent transaction type, both in count and total amount. Withdrawals and purchases follow, with similar transaction amounts but differing frequencies.

---

#### 2. What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?

```sql
WITH historical_deposit AS (
SELECT customer_id, txn_type,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) AS deposit_count,
	   SUM (CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount END ) AS total_amount
	   FROM customer_transactions
	   GROUP BY 1,2 )
	   SELECT txn_type, 
	   ROUND(AVG (deposit_count), 2) avg_count,
	   ROUND(AVG (total_amount), 2) AS avg_amount
	   FROM historical_deposit
	   WHERE txn_type ='deposit' 
	   GROUP BY 1;
```

| avg_count | avg_amount |
|-----------|------------|
| 5         | 2718.34   |

On average, each customer made 5 deposit transactions, with a cumulative average amount of $2,718.34, indicating a moderate level of engagement.

---

#### 3. For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?

```sql
WITH txn_counts AS (
    SELECT customer_id,
           EXTRACT(MONTH FROM txn_date) AS month_number,  
           TO_CHAR(txn_date, 'FMMonth') AS month_name,   
           COUNT(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN 1 END) AS deposit_count,
           COUNT(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'purchase' THEN 1 END) AS purchase_count,
           COUNT(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'withdrawal' THEN 1 END) AS withdrawal_count
    FROM customer_transactions
    GROUP BY customer_id, month_number, month_name
)
SELECT month_name, COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM txn_counts
WHERE deposit_count > 1 
  AND (purchase_count = 1 OR withdrawal_count = 1)
GROUP BY month_name, month_number
ORDER BY month_number;
```

| month_name | customer_count |
|------------|----------------|
| January    | 115            |
| February   | 108            |
| March      | 113            |
| April      | 50             |


The highest customer activity was observed in January, with 115 customers meeting the specified criteria.

#### 4. What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month?

```sql
WITH MonthlyBalance AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM txn_date) AS month,
        SUM(CASE 
            WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount 
            ELSE -txn_amount 
        END) AS monthly_amount
    FROM 
        customer_transactions
    GROUP BY 
        customer_id, month
)

SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    month,
    SUM(monthly_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY month) AS closing_balance
FROM 
    MonthlyBalance
ORDER BY 
    customer_id, month;
```

##### Sample Output for Customers 1-5:

| customer_id | month | closing_balance |
|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| 1           | 1     | 312             |
| 1           | 3     | -640            |
| 2           | 1     | 549             |
| 2           | 3     | 610             |
| 3           | 1     | 144             |
| 3           | 2     | -821            |
| 3           | 3     | -1222           |
| 3           | 4     | -729            |
| 4           | 1     | 848             |
| 4           | 3     | 655             |
| 5           | 1     | 954             |
| 5           | 3     | -1923           |
| 5           | 4     | -2413           |
---

#### 5. What is the percentage of customers who increase their closing balance by more than 5%?

_Note: In this query, the evaluation has been expanded to include scenarios where customers with negative balances move into positive territory or significantly reduce their deficit by more than 5%._

```sql
WITH MonthlyBalance AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM txn_date) AS month,
        SUM(CASE 
            WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount 
            WHEN txn_type = 'withdrawal' THEN -txn_amount
            WHEN txn_type = 'purchase' THEN -txn_amount
            ELSE 0 
        END) AS monthly_amount
    FROM 
        customer_transactions
    GROUP BY 
        customer_id, month
),
ClosingBalance AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        month,
        SUM(monthly_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY month) AS closing_balance
    FROM 
        MonthlyBalance
),
PercentageIncrease AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        closing_balance,
        LAG(closing_balance) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY month) AS previous_balance
    FROM 
        ClosingBalance
)
SELECT 
    ROUND(
        (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE 
            (closing_balance - previous_balance) / NULLIF(previous_balance, 0) > 0.05
            OR (previous_balance < 0 AND closing_balance >= 0)  
        ) * 100.0) / NULLIF(COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE previous_balance IS NOT NULL), 0),
    2) AS percentage_increase
FROM 
    PercentageIncrease;
```

| percentage_increase |
|---------------------|
|55.16                |

Approximately 55.16% of customers were found to increase their closing balance by more than 5%.

### C-Data Allocation Challenge

#### To test out a few different hypotheses - the Data Bank team wants to run an experiment where different groups of customers would be allocated data using 3 different options:

- Option 1: data is allocated based off the amount of money at the end of the previous month
- Option 2: data is allocated on the average amount of money kept in the account in the previous 30 days
- Option 3: data is updated real-time

For this multi-part challenge question - you have been requested to generate the following data elements to help the Data Bank team estimate how much data will need to be provisioned for each option:

#### Running customer balance column that includes the impact each transaction

```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    txn_type,
    txn_date,
    txn_amount,
    SUM(CASE 
        WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount 
        ELSE -txn_amount 
    END) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_date) AS running_balance
FROM 
    customer_transactions
ORDER BY 
    customer_id, txn_date;
```
##### Sample Output for Customers 1-5:

| customer_id | txn_type  | txn_date  | txn_amount | running_balance |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| 1           | deposit   | 2020-01-02 | 312        | 312             |
| 1           | purchase  | 2020-03-05 | 612        | -300            |
| 1           | deposit   | 2020-03-17 | 324        | 24              |
| 1           | purchase  | 2020-03-19 | 664        | -640            |
| 2           | deposit   | 2020-01-03 | 549        | 549             |

The cumulative balance for each customer is calculated to reflect the impact of every transaction. This method may be suited for real-time allocation (Option 3), as it provides precise and up-to-date information. However, the need for continuous updates and higher storage could make it more resource-intensive.

---

#### Customer balance at the end of each month

```sql
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        TO_CHAR (txn_date, 'Month') AS month,
        SUM(CASE 
            WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount 
            ELSE -txn_amount 
        END) AS balance
    FROM 
        customer_transactions
    GROUP BY 
        customer_id, month
	ORDER BY 
    customer_id, month;
```

##### Sample Output for Customers 1-5:

| customer_id | month      | balance |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| 1           | January    | 312     |
| 1           | March      | -952    |
| 2           | January    | 549     |
| 2           | March      | 61      |
| 3           | April      | 493     |
| 3           | February   | -965    |
| 3           | January    | 144     |
| 3           | March      | -401    |
| 4           | January    | 848     |
| 4           | March      | -193    |
| 5           | April      | -490    |
| 5           | January    | 954     |
| 5           | March      | -2877   |


Balances at the end of each month are summarized, which could be ideal for monthly allocation (Option 1). By focusing only on month-end values, data volume is minimized efficiently. However, intra-month fluctuations may not be captured, potentially reducing accuracy for customers with variable balances.

---

#### Minimum, average and maximum values of the running balance for each customer

```sql
   WITH Balance AS (
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(CASE 
        WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount 
        ELSE -txn_amount 
    END) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_date) AS running_balance
FROM 
    customer_transactions
ORDER BY 
    customer_id, txn_date)
	
SELECT customer_id,
       MIN (running_balance) AS min_running_balance,
	   ROUND(AVG(running_balance),2) AS avg_running_balance,
	   MAX(running_balance) AS max_running_balance
FROM Balance
GROUP BY customer_id;
```


##### Sample Output for Customers 1-5:

| customer_id | min_running_balance | avg_running_balance | max_running_balance |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1           | -640                | -151.00             | 312                 |
| 2           | 549                 | 579.50              | 610                 |

Key metrics, including minimum, average, and maximum running balances, are determined for each customer. This approach may support average-based allocation (Option 2), offering a balanced view of data needs. While less demanding than real-time updates, its effectiveness could vary depending on the consistency of customer balances over time.

#### Using all of the data available - how much data would have been required for each option on a monthly basis?

When assessing the data requirements for each option, the monthly provision calculations highlight several differences:

- Option 1:
    - Minimizes data storage and is simple to implement.
    - However, it may overlook intra-month variations in customer behavior.
- Option 2:
    - Provides a more comprehensive view of customer behavior.
    - Balances computational efficiency and data accuracy.
    - Avoids the high computational and storage costs of real-time tracking.
- Option 3:
    - Offers the highest accuracy and flexibility for real-time allocation.
    - Comes with significant computational and storage overhead.

Option 2 appears to be the best compromise, balancing data accuracy with computational efficiency. It allows for responsive allocation while minimizing the resource demands associated with real-time tracking. The estimated data requirements for Option 2 can align well with practical resource management, ensuring effective performance with minimal complexity.
